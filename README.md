# Mathematics Projetc

  The math module at EPITECH consists of seeing concepts of mathematics with a given project, this project consists in applying the concept learned in a defined program to be carried out (language of your choice).

# Project :

  **101pong :**
    The goal of this project is to work on a 3D version of this game (or of the Breakoutgame. . . ). Only one paddle will be considered, located in the (Oxy) plane (which is defined by the equation z= 0).
  
  **109titration :**
   To find the concentration of preservative in the soda, the volume of added titrant at theequivalence point(ie at the middle of the pH-jump) must be read. There are two main approaches to do so: <br/>
   **•the derivative method [...]<br/>**
   **•the parallel tangents method[...]<br/>**
   You must code the first approach here. Your program has to read titrant volume (in ml) and pH couples froma csv file, and output:<br/>
   1. the derivative values for each given volume,
   2. the closest point from the equivalence point amongst those given points,
   3. the second derivative values for each given volume,
   4. an estimate of the second derivative values every 0.1 ml around the above closest point from theequivalence point, using linear interpolation,
   5. the proper equivalence point, estimated from the second derivative.
